            <h2>About the Red Fort</h2>
            <p>The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is one of India's most iconic monuments. It is located in Old Delhi and served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years, from 1648 until the British took control in 1857. The fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is renowned for its grand architecture, intricate decorations, and historical significance.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Mughal Era (Construction and Early Use)
                Commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638, the Red Fort was built as the new capital, shifting from Agra to Delhi.
                
                Construction took 10 years (1638–1648) and was supervised by the architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the same architect who designed the Taj Mahal.
                
                The fort was originally known as Qila-e-Mubarak (Blessed Fort).
                
                It served as the political and cultural center of the Mughal Empire.
                
                2. Decline of Mughal Power
                The Mughal Empire weakened after Aurangzeb's reign (1658–1707).
                
                In 1739, Persian ruler Nadir Shah invaded Delhi and looted the fort, including the famous Peacock Throne.
                
                The fort was further attacked by the Marathas in the late 18th century and later came under British control after the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803).
                
                3. British Rule and 1857 Revolt
                The Red Fort was a major site during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (First War of Independence).
                
                After suppressing the revolt, the British exiled the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, and destroyed parts of the fort, including gardens and some palaces.
                
                It was used as a military camp by the British.
                
                4. Post-Independence and Modern Era
                After India gained independence in 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the national flag at the Red Fort.
                
                Since then, it has been a symbol of India's independence, and every year on August 15, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag and delivers a speech.
                
                In 2007, UNESCO designated the Red Fort as a World Heritage Site.</p>
